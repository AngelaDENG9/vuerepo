Thorpe was ten years old when he first performed on stage and by the age of 17 was a seasoned performer when he moved to Sydney and got a regular gig as Surf City in Kings Cross. He joined with The Aztecs. As lead singer of Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs, he had success in the 1960s with 'Blue Day', 'Poison Ivy', 'Over the Rainbow', 'Sick and Tired', and 'Mashed Potato'; and in the 1970s with 'Most People I Know Think That I'm Crazy'.

He joined with The Aztecs. As lead singer of Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs, he had success in the 1960s with 'Blue Day', 'Poison Ivy', 'Over the Rainbow', 'Sick and Tired', and 'Mashed Potato'; and in the 1970s with 'Most People I Know Think That I'm Crazy'. Thorpe also performed as a solo artist and worked as a producer and composed music scores for TV series including 'War of the Worlds', 'Star Trek: The Next Generation', 'Columbo', 'Eight Is Enough' and 'Hard Time on Planet Earth'. He was inducted in the ARIA Hall of Fame in 1991 and was posthumously appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the Queen's Birthday Honours list for his contributions as a musician, songwriter, producer and preservation of contemporary Australian music through his vision for his peers like the successful 'It's A Long Way To The Top' concert and CD/DVD and plans for Support Act Ltd and a rock and roll retirement village.

Although he received further roles in 'Dust in the Sun' (1958), and in the early television series 'Whiplash', he drifted in and out of hospital, where he was treated for tuberculosis, and in and out of gaol for repeated offences against liquor laws. Tudawali's life gained new purpose when he was elected vice-president of the Northern Territory Council for Aboriginal Rights in 1966. He supported the Aboriginal stockmen who had walked off Wave Hill cattle station. He died after an incident with fire at Bagot Native Settlement in Darwin in the Northern Territory.

Arthur then went on to shoot a total of 39 Australian feature films as cinematographer, and two as director, including the classic films 'The Sentimental Bloke' (1919) and 'On Our Selection' (1920). He also shot numerous newsreel items and documentaries, plus cinema advertisements, often in the Solarchrome Colour process that he co-developed with George Malcolm. Arthur's last feature was 'A Son is Born' (1946), however he was still working with his camera right up to the time of his death in Sept. 1963.

Arthur then went on to shoot a total of 39 Australian feature films as cinematographer, and two as director, including the classic films 'The Sentimental Bloke' (1919) and 'On Our Selection' (1920). He also shot numerous newsreel items and documentaries, plus cinema advertisements, often in the Solarchrome Colour process that he co-developed with George Malcolm. Arthur's last feature was 'A Son is Born' (1946), however he was still working with his camera right up to the time of his death in Sept. 1963.

The loss of many early Australian films, the inconsistency of early film credits and the lack of her own account makes it difficult to establish Lyell's exact roles. However, while only credited as assistant director on two films, the testimony of contemporaries, press reports, letters and production documents make it clear that as well as a highly regarded actor, she was widely acknowledged and admired as a film scriptwriter, editor, producer and director. Her career spanned 18 years, commencing with acting in the theatre and concluding with the posthumous release in 1926 of 'Peter Vernon's Silence', a Longford Lyell production co-written by Lyell and Longford and 'The Pioneeers' for which she is credited with adapting the screenplay from Katharine Susannah Pritchard's novel. In a productive personal and professional partnership, Lyell and Longford made 28 films together, with Lyell performing in 21, including 'The Sentimental Bloke' (1919), its sequel 'Ginger Mick' (1921) and the 'Rudd's New Selection' (1921).

Arthur then went on to shoot a total of 39 Australian feature films as cinematographer, and two as director, including the classic films 'The Sentimental Bloke' (1919) and 'On Our Selection' (1920). He also shot numerous newsreel items and documentaries, plus cinema advertisements, often in the Solarchrome Colour process that he co-developed with George Malcolm. Arthur's last feature was 'A Son is Born' (1946), however he was still working with his camera right up to the time of his death in Sept. 1963.

The loss of many early Australian films, the inconsistency of early film credits and the lack of her own account makes it difficult to establish Lyell's exact roles. However, while only credited as assistant director on two films, the testimony of contemporaries, press reports, letters and production documents make it clear that as well as a highly regarded actor, she was widely acknowledged and admired as a film scriptwriter, editor, producer and director. Her career spanned 18 years, commencing with acting in the theatre and concluding with the posthumous release in 1926 of 'Peter Vernon's Silence', a Longford Lyell production co-written by Lyell and Longford and 'The Pioneeers' for which she is credited with adapting the screenplay from Katharine Susannah Pritchard's novel. In a productive personal and professional partnership, Lyell and Longford made 28 films together, with Lyell performing in 21, including 'The Sentimental Bloke' (1919), its sequel 'Ginger Mick' (1921) and the 'Rudd's New Selection' (1921).

Arthur then went on to shoot a total of 39 Australian feature films as cinematographer, and two as director, including the classic films 'The Sentimental Bloke' (1919) and 'On Our Selection' (1920). He also shot numerous newsreel items and documentaries, plus cinema advertisements, often in the Solarchrome Colour process that he co-developed with George Malcolm. Arthur's last feature was 'A Son is Born' (1946), however he was still working with his camera right up to the time of his death in Sept. 1963.
