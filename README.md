# VueNFSA Reflection:
I experienced several design and technical challenges in developing this website. The main features of this website include search function, zoom and rotation of images, and dynamic text and title color and size changes displayed on mouse hover. The implementation of these features not only enhanced the user's interactive experience, but also gave me a deeper understanding of the technical requirements of front-end development. However, since this was my first time to come into contact with APIs and the implementation of related dynamic data, the whole process was very challenging for me.

First of all, the zoom and rotate function of the image is the core part of this project. I wanted the user to be able to freely view all the details of the image, and to be able to view the image from different angles by rotating it. To do this, I used JavaScript and CSS techniques to implement this functionality. During the implementation, I encountered problems with misaligned layouts and distorted images, especially when it came to ensuring a consistent experience across different device sizes. To overcome these challenges, I referred to the documentation from MDN Web Docs, especially the sections on CSS media queries and JavaScript DOM manipulation.

Additionally, the implementation of the search functionality was another challenge for me as this was my first encounter with an API, and I learned how to dynamically retrieve data through the API and display it on the page. In the process, I encountered issues such as cross-domain requests and asynchronous data handling. I was frustrated by these issues, but by consulting Stack Overflow and the related developer community, I learned how to handle the response data from the API and make sure that the user's query could be displayed on the page in real time.

To improve the user experience, I also designed the interaction effect on mouse hover. When the user mouses over an image, descriptive text is displayed, and when the mouse moves over a caption, the text turns blue and zooms in. This not only makes the page more interactive, but also directs the user's attention to specific content through visual effects. To achieve this effect, I used some basic features of CSS to make the visual changes on hover smooth and natural.

During the development process, I not only learned about technical implementation, but also realized the balance between design and user experience. How to improve the user's interaction experience while ensuring the functionality is realized is a question I kept thinking about in this project. By referring to standards such as MDN Web Docs and the W3C's HTML5 validation specification, I ensured that the site's HTML code was standards-compliant and that the CSS was responsive across different device sizes.

However, in the process of committing the final version to GitHub, I ran into an unexpected problem. Before uploading the code, I realized that my local project files had been accidentally corrupted and were not working properly. As a result, I had to reorganize all the code and re-upload it to GitHub all at once, which explains why the code's commit history shows the same point in time. While GitHub's best practice is to commit code regularly to show the development process, due to this unforeseen circumstance, I was only able to upload the entire project at once. Nonetheless, the re-uploaded code maintains the integrity of the original development process, with the same functionality and design as the previous version.

Overall, this project deepened my understanding of the front-end development technology stack, especially in terms of dynamic data interaction and user experience design. Despite the challenges of using APIs and handling asynchronous requests for the first time, a fully functional website was successfully realized through continuous learning and problem solving. This experience not only improved technical skills, but also enhanced the ability to address challenges and find solutions during the design and development process.
